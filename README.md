Elias
=====

Elias is a place where you quickly share ideas, random bits discovered on the Internet (or books) etc., and have discussions with your friends.

The discussion and informations iteself could then be saved to personal knowledge database for later use.

It's more like social version of Evernote, or a more private and flexiable version of Goolge+.
